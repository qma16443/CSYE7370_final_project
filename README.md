### Project Overview

This my final project, in this project I trained an agent to pick up yellow bananas that are scattered throughout a square world. The agent
 must learn to navigate in its environment to reach yellow bananas (reward of +1 each) while avoiding to collect
 blue bananas (reward of -1 each). 

### Instructions
